# How to Use
The program takes in a .json file that describes a layout that the program then converts into an image. The input file is passed to the program using the argument `--input_file=filename.json` where filename is the name of the `.json` file you want to be used as input. The argument `--output_file=filename.bmp` is the flag that can be used to determine the name of the output file, where filename is the name of the `.bmp` file. Examples are given in the examples folder.
